WHAT IS IT?

This plugin basically replaces DokuWiki's own authentication features
with the HTTP authentication configured in the Webserver. As only login name and
password are known:
- the user's real name is set to his login name
- a possibly non-working email address is constructed with the "emaildomain"
  config setting
- all users are part of the DokuWiki group configured with the "group" config
  setting (default: "user")
- users that are specified in the list configured with "adminusers" will
  also be member of the group configured with "admingroup" (default: "admin")

These restrictions may not suit your setup, in which case you should check out
the "authsplit" plugin at https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:authhttp.
